This is a proof-of-concept Curriculum Vitae editor. Some data is downloaded from an endpoint, some you add manually.

To be able to sync the project add the following properties to `local.properties` (below are the example values):
```
store.file=local.properties
store.password=dummy_store.password
key.password=dummy_key.password
key.alias=dummy_key.alias
BuildTestCoverageEnabled=false
```
